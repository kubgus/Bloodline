# Bloodline

The framework you didn't know you needed. Because you never did need it. But it's extremely useful.

## To the future with IRCS 🚀
*Inherited Root Component System*
<br>
* Object oriented
* Easily manageable
* More grounded in reality
* Solid programming principles
* Scalable

### How?

In typical ECS, you create entities, which are basically just numbers that components then get assigned and that's how they know how to work together. In IRCS, all entities (Roots in BL) are classes. They own their components. It doesn't sound that cool, until you think of inheritance. I'll let you figure it out, but try it. I think it's really cool. Maybe give me your opinion. 👋

## Cross-platform ⭐
This service is not cross-platform, yet, and only works on Winodws. But I'm planning to add the option to export elsewhere.
